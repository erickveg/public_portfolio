Data Science projects by Erick Vega as part of the course CSE250 (Data Science Programming) at Brigham Young University-Idaho

## Project 1: What's in a name?
This project will analyze the usage of specific names throughout history, from relatives' names to actors' names. The data has been taken from a cleaned data set of birth names by year with counts for US states. The analysis will include customized charts that come in handy in order to visualize the total of children named with a particular name over a specific range of time. The main purpose of this project is to understand how and what external influences affected the way parents named their children.


## Project 2: Are we missing JSON on our flights?
This project will analyze multiple cases of delayed flights on 7 U.S airports had over a period of 10 years (between 2005 and 2010).The most relevant information will be the number of delayed flights per month, the number of delayed flights per airport, how many minutes of delay, and the main causes for those delays. This analysis could be used to help people prevent traveling on specific months or help airports and airlines anticipate potential risks on their future flights, saving them resources like money and time.

## Project 3: Finding relationships in baseball
In this project, we will define connections between different entities in baseball. These connections will take the form of tables and charts to ease the interpretation of their meaning. We will focus on the relationships between baseball players, their teams, salaries, and achievements along with their careers.


## Project 4: Classifying Homes (Machine Learning)
The following project is intended to create a Machine Learning (ML) model able to identify whether or not a home was built before the 80s. Our model will use around 30 different features to learn what is a "Before 1980" house. Our model will be measured in terms of its precision and accuracy to ensure its reliability. ML models help to predict new unknown information, find hidden patterns, save industry millions of dollars, and make "smarter" tools to enhance human life.


## Project 5: The war with Star Wars (Machine Learning)
Throughout this project, we will take a disorganized dataset and create a machine learning model from it. The data set that we will use comes from a survey of thousands of people on "Star Wars" preferences. We will try to find out if there is a relationship between people's preferences and their income. However, we will focus on different methods of cleaning and organizing a messy dataset.
