## About Me
__Computer Science__ + __Software Design__ student at Brigham Young University Idaho

Passionate about technology! I believe that technology aids humans to develop their best attributes and have a healthier life, that's why I consider quality and efficiency key for the development of any piece of software.

Writing code is awesome, but the best part is when it actually runs!
