## About Me
__Computer Science__ + __Software Design__ student at Brigham Young University Idaho

2+ years of experience programming mainly in Python and C++

Passionate about technology! I believe that technology aids humans to develop their best attributes and have a healthier life, that's why I write code.                                                                            

Writing code is awesome, but the best part is when it actually runs!

## Projects on this repository

### [Data Science Projects](Data%20Science%20Projects)

This folder contains multiple projects related to data analysis and Machine Learning concepts. All the projects are documented and have graphs and charts designed by me for analysis. 

__Gained Skills:__
- Perform data engineering using Pandas
- Convert a word problem into requirements
- Clean and format large datasets
- Use SQL queries with Python through APIs
- Find hidden patterns and relate them to external variables
- Train Machine Learning models for predictive behaviors
- Design relevant data visuals using Altair

### [Data Structures Tutorial](Data%20Structures%20by%20Erick)

This is a detailed document I wrote about the most commonly used data structures in programming. I analyze their use cases supported by code examples, time efficiency analysis, and problems to solve for the reader.

__Gained Skills:__
- Ability to simplify complex concepts into simpler ideas
- Solid understanding of different data structures
- Optimize algorithms to achieve the best performance
- Write solid and clean documentation

### [[App] Golf Swing Analyzer]([App]%20Golf%20Enhancer%20with%20CV%20and%20ML%20(Python))

This App was developed with the goal of making it easier for golfers to improve their skills without a human couch. OpenCV and other libraries were vital to analyze several videos and train our ML model in order to evaluate the input video. This project can definitely grow and even be marketable. A video demonstration is included.

__Gained Skills:__
- Implement strong Encapsulation practices
- Strong interaction with computer vision libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe)
- Perform a full cycle of ML model training (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Ability to communicate, lead, and report on a development team

### [[Game] Apollo 11 Simulator]([Game]%20Apollo%2011%20Simulator%20(C++))

This Game/Simulator replicates some of the software and hardware functionalities of the original Lunar Module(LM) that was able to land in the moon on July 16, 1969. The user's objective is to land the LM on a landing area randomly generated on the surface of the ground. This exiting project required implementing Newtonâ€™s laws of motion, moon gravity and the original features of the LM. 

__Gained Skills:__
- Design a program using flowcharts, pseudocode, Structure chats, data flow diagrams, and class relational diagrams
- Achieve high levels of software design principles like Fidelity and Robustness
- Learn to research on a field out of my field (Physics)
- Perform black-box testing for every function and class
- High exposure to data structures, memory management and class declarations in C++

### [[Game] Artillery M777 Simulator]([Game]%20Artillery%20M777%20Simulator%20(C++))

This Game/Simulator represents the basic functionalies of the M777 Howitzer which is a British artillery piece. The user's objective is to manipulate the direction of the howitzer so when it fires the bullet can hit a target randomly generated on the ground. 

__Gained Skills:__
- Achieve high levels of software design principles like Convenience and Abstraction
- Determine when and why data protection principles are important
- Ability to do pair-programming and manage projects within a team 
- Perform white-box testing for every function and class
- Automate thetesting process within Visual Studio
- Convert client requirements into a technical plan
