## Introduction

Welcome my Python Data Structures Tutorial. The purpose of this guide is to give you a basic but strong understanding of some of the most used data structures in the programming world. Python will be used to explain each topic, and a basic understanding of the language will be enough to succeed throughout this guide which will present the following modules:

* [Stacks](1_stacks.md)
* [Linked Lists](2_linked_lists.md)
* [Trees](3_trees.md)

Each module will explain the main features of the structure through concepts, images and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. A solution will be provided, but avoid the temptation to look it before having tried with all your resources and capacity.
